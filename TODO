TODO list:

	- add support for a simple config file (*.ini) to set some parameters like logpath and how many variables are exported. At least which are written out to
	  a file, which should help to hold the file smaller. Maybe adjust sample rate too?
	
	- add possibility to en/disable disk_based logging
	
	- show logo when logging to disk is active
